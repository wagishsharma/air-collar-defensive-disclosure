# Air Collar – Defensive Public Disclosure (Open Patent Release)

**Inventor:** Wagish Sharma  
**Date:** Publicly disclosed on 2 December 2025  
**Status:** Public Prior Art Disclosure / Open Patent Release  
**Purpose:** Establish prior art, prevent exclusive patenting, and enable open development or licensed commercialization.

## 1. Abstract
Air Collar is a wearable front-neck purification device that filters ambient air and directs it upward to form a clean-air curtain in front of the user's breathing zone. The device reduces exposure to particulate pollution (PM2.5, PM10) and smoke while allowing natural, unobstructed breathing without any facial seal.

### Intended Use
This device is designed for adult and senior users.  
It is not recommended for infants or toddlers.

## 2. Technical Field
Personal air purification devices, wearable environmental health systems, consumer wellness electronics.

---

## 3. Background
Existing solutions have limitations:

- **Masks (N95, KN95):** uncomfortable, reduce adherence, create airflow resistance, poorly fitted in real-life use.
- **Neck fans:** blow unfiltered air upward, increasing exposure.
- **Portable purifiers:** stationary, not usable outdoors.
- **Powered respirators:** bulky, visually intrusive, not suitable for daily use.

There is a need for a comfortable, wearable device that delivers purified air outdoors without covering the face.

## 4. Summary of the Invention
The invention is a **front-worn air purification collar** that includes:

1. **Multi-Stage Filter Module:**  
   - Pre-filter  
   - HEPA filter  
   - Activated carbon layer  

2. **Micro-Fan Assembly:**  
   Low-pressure dual micro-fans pulling air through the filter.

3. **Air Distribution Channel:**  
   Internal duct that splits purified airflow to multiple exit vents.

4. **Upward Vents:**  
   Angled (45–70°) outlets creating a vertical laminar sheet of clean air ("air curtain") in front of the face.

5. **Positive Micro-Pressure Zone:**  
   Purified air dominates the breathing region, reducing infiltration of polluted ambient air.

6. **Non-Occlusive Breathing:**  
   No seal around nose/mouth; user breathes naturally.

7. **Ergonomic Neckband Form Factor:**  
   Lightweight, front-focused design suitable for adults and seniors.

## 5. Detailed Description

### 5.1 Housing
- Neckband-style frame resting on the collarbone.
- Central purifier module containing filters and fans.
- Side arms housing electronics and battery.

### 5.2 Air Pathway
**Ambient Air → Intake → Filter Module → Micro-Fans → Distribution Duct → Upward Vents → Breathing Zone**

### 5.3 Filtration
- Pre-filter for large particles.  
- HEPA filter for fine particulate matter.  
- Activated carbon for smoke and VOC reduction.  
- Configuration ensures quieter airflow and reduced noise.

### 5.4 Air Curtain Operation
- Air exits through multiple angled vents.
- Produces a soft, upward laminar flow.
- Creates a localized clean-air bubble 5–12 cm in front of the face.
- Does not force air directly into nostrils.

### 5.5 Safety Characteristics
- Designed for adults; device is non-occlusive.
- User can always breathe ambient air freely.
- Components fully enclosed.
- Airflow levels maintained within safe limits.

## 6. Claims (Open and Non-Exclusive)

1. A wearable front-neck collar delivering filtered upward airflow to a user’s breathing zone.  
2. Formation of a clean-air curtain using angled vents without face sealing.  
3. Creation of a positive-pressure micro-environment in front of the nose and mouth.  
4. Integration of multi-stage filtration into a neck-worn form factor.  
5. Use of micro-fans and ducts to produce purified laminar airflow.  
6. A non-occlusive respiratory protection device enabling natural breathing.  
7. A wearable purifier optimized for adult and senior outdoor use.

These claims are released publicly to form prior art and prevent exclusive patenting by any third party.
